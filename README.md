Data Organization and Transformation

## Objectives

- Identify basic data organization and transformation in a python notebook
- Save plots
- Manage files in GitHub and VS Code
- Write in Markdown
- Install computational tools

## Deliverables

- Blog post in Markdown
- six visualizations of provided data
- documentation of successful installations in a screenshot

## Instructions

### General

Make blog post in `blogpost.md` that compares data transformations in Google
Sheets to those in a python notebook. Once you are done, tackle the installation
process to get python 3, git, and gatorgrade on your system.

The purpose of this lab is to allow you to compare data transformations in
Google sheets with transformation in a python notebook, and install
computer programs that allow you to process data for future labs. Processing data
becomes easier with the right tools even though installing those tools can be
difficult.

As you execute the pre-written python notebook, locate the python version of the
transformation steps that you did in the previous lab. Briefly summarize what you
notice about the coded version compared to Google Sheets.

Write the blog post as if it could be viewed by the public. A future
lab will create a GitHub website with blog posts that actually
_can_ be viewed online!

Record references you used in this lab.
Relevant in-line references should be included like this
[[1](https://commonmark.org/help/),
[2](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables)].
The referenced links should also appear in the Reference Section of
the deliverable markdown file as a numbered list like this:

### Steps

- TODO: (Recommended) Make your GitHub repo available locally on your computer. Specifically,
  you will need to be able to access `data.md` locally.
- TODO: Create a top-level heading in blogpost.md that says `Data Transformation in a Python Notebook`
- TODO: Create an H2 heading in blogpost.md that says `References`
- TODO: Create at least two other headings to keep your blog post organized and clear.
- TODO: Open the following python notebook file in colab by clicking on the link [Colab: Installation Instructions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2024/course-materials/blob/main/notes/20240202_lab03_data_transformation.ipynb)
- TODO: Click on the [save a copy in drive] button to save your changes into your google drive
- TODO: Run the first block by pressing play button
- TODO: Run the second block by pressing play button, and upload the `data.md` file from your computer
- TODO: Run the third block
- TODO: Run the fourth block
- TODO: Run the fifth block and describe what happens in the blogpost.md and copy the
  output as a fenced code block into blogpost.md.
  [More on fenced code blocks](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/)
- TODO: READ the sixth block, add print statements
- TODO: run the sixth block and copy the code itself into a fenced code block in your markdown
- TODO: describe how the printed values relate to order of the variables
- TODO: eventually, run each block one at a time to produce plots
- TODO: fill the appropriate title, x label, y label for every plot by carefully
  examining the code to make an educated guess about what is happening.
- TODO: on the last block, also adjust the numbers next to `figsize` to change the size of the figure
  - the goal is to make square grid lines (not squashed or stretched)
- TODO: for Every plot, with title and labels, save an image
  - TODO: plot 1 save as `line-initial-ipynb` in assets/images
  - TODO: plot of transformation 1 save as `line-01-ipynb` in assets/images
  - TODO: plot of transformation 2 save as `line-02-ipynb` in assets/images
  - TODO: plot of transformation 3 save as `line-03-ipynb` in assets/images
  - TODO: plot of transformation 4 save as `line-04-ipynb` in assets/images
  - TODO: plot of the final save as `final-ipynb` in assets/images
- TODO: embed every plot into your blogpost
- TODO: compare your google sheets plots to the ipynb plots in words
  - Optional: embed those images as well!

### Questions

- TODO: what benefits and drawbacks do you see about using ipynb?
- TODO: what happens if you close and reopen your ipynb file?

#### Collaborative Installation Work

- TODO: Find a partner to help you install python, git, and gatorgrade if
  you do not already have them installed.
- TODO: If you have python, git, and gatorgrade locally on your computer,
  pair up with someone who does not yet have the tools.
- TODO: write the name of your partner, and at least three steps you
  described/completed together to install programs using a Markdown list
  like this:

<br>

1. This is an example of a numbered markdown list
2. Here is the second entry
3. Gatorgrade will be checking to make sure you have typed 1. 2. 3.
   in your blogpost.md file
